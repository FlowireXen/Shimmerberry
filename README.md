Shimmerberry is my personal mod that adds some vanilla-like/extending<br>
content to the game, including fun references to other games!

# Content
My silly mod currently adds:
- 3 Blinds (1 Boss Blind)
- 1 Deck with 1 respective [Card Sleeve](https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves)
- 15 Jokers

Start with a 32 Card "[Scartare Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game))" (all ranks below 7 are missing):<br>
Start with 10 hand size and 0 discards.<br>
Discard 2 random cards with each hand played.<br>
(The Scartare-[Sleeve](https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves) works exactly the same!)
